# JSdns.js #

### What? ###

JSdns.js is a simple client-side DNS resolver. Supply it with a hostname and it will will resolve it to an IP address and FQDN along with the amount of time it took in milliseconds (ms). 

### Why? ###

I'm new to JavaScript, learning more and more each day. I'm currently a Jnr DevOps Engineer and this is a way for me to learn and also provide a practical module to use.

### How? ###

`npm install jsdns`
